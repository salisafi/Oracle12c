-- %TYPE  -Anchore datatype 

-- Datatype which you assign to a variable based on a database object

-- They are dynamicaly dependent on their underlying structure 

-- Syntax :        <<<<     variable_name Typed-attribute%TYPE;   >>>>

-- Type can be a previously defined PLSQL variable or a field of a table

-- %TYPE is a direct reference to an underlying database object


-------------------

-- First I create a new table called StudentTest then Inserted some values to it one by one


CREATE TABLE StudentTest( 
stu_id  NUMBER(2),
first_name VARCHAR2(10));

INSERT INTO StudentTest
VALUES
(5, 'Sali');

SELECT stu_id AS "Student num", first_name AS "Student name" FROM StudentTest;


-----------------------------------

-- Then created an anchore variable to fetch data from query and use it in the code


SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;

DECLARE 
    v_first_name StudentTest.first_name%TYPE; -- ******
BEGIN
    SELECT first_name 
    INTO v_first_name 
    FROM StudentTest
    WHERE stu_id = 5;
    
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Student name is ' || v_first_name);
END;
